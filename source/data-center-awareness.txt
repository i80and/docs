Data Center Awareness
=====================

.. default-domain:: mongodb

Modern SaaS applications have global audiences that require globally distributed
data to work effectively. When users access an application from all over the
world, you should keep compute and data resources as close as possible to the
end users. A European user requesting North American resources can dramatically
increase application latency, creating a poor user experience.

In order to minimize latency, the user should be accessing data contained in
their local region's data center.

What Is Data Center Awareness?
------------------------------

You can configure MongoDB to be data center aware. This means it is possible to
store, or "pin", a subset of your data to a particular server or set of
servers. For example, you can use data center awareness to implement the
following requirements:

- **Rack awareness:** pinning data to certain racks,

- **Location awareness:** pinning data to certain locations,

- **Tiered storage:** assigning frequently-accessed data to faster storage
  devices such as :term:`SSDs <SSD>`, and the rest of the data to spinning
  disks.

Deployment strategies
---------------------

You can deploy MongoDB's data center awareness in multiple configurations.

Region Pinning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Data must reside in a specific region and may not leave that region.

This configuration gives high availability within a single region and pins
data to a region. This ensures that data and its replica copies are all
contained within a single region.

In the event that the primary node fails, there are replicas available within
the region to provide redundancy. In the event that the entire data center
loses availability, local users will have no servers available to service their
request.

Distributed Availability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users access data from the local data center giving them local reads and
writes. A local replica is available in the event that the primary loses
availability. In the event the entire local data center is unreachable, users
are able to access data from a new primary in a remote data center.
