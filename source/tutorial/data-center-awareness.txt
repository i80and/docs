Data Center Awareness Tutorial

.. default-domain:: mongodb

This guide demonstrates configuring a MongoDB cluster for
:ref:`data-center-awareness` by configuring a sharded cluster to store data
locally for users in London, New York and Sydney.

This application uses a London shard to store all London user profiles; a New
York shard to store all New York City user profiles; and a Sydney shard to
store all Sydney user profiles.

Summary
-------

This tutorial has demonstrated how to store user profiles in shards based on
region. This is a basic example, but you can adapt it to achieve pinning data to
more or fewer regions, or even for tagging shards as being for analytics or
real time queries.

You can do more configuration for advanced deployments. Shards can have multiple
shard tags, and tag ranges can change as frequently as desired. Tags can also
span more than a single shard if there is a need to have multiple shards using
the same tag.
